#### 7. (in case you need it) Synchronize with updates from the upstream

Sometimes you may need to update your fork with the latest changes from the upstream. This may happen when, for example, the main branch was update since you opened your PR and contains conflicts with your changes.

```sh
# 1) Go to the "my-new-branch" branch of your fork ("origin")
git checkout add-my-name

# 2) Fetch the commits from the "upstream"
git fetch upstream

# 3) Merge the changes from the "main" branch of the "upstream" into your the "my-new-branch" branch of your "origin"
git merge upstream/main

# 4) Resolve merge conflicts if any and commit your merge
git commit -m "Merged from upstream"

# 5) Push the changes to your fork ("origin")
git push
```
